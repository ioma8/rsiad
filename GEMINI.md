The current project is rust project, which utilises the xsynth software synthesizer to make singing warmup exercises (triads). Read README.md at start for more info.

Any changes you make, make them in iterations. That means you will make one small change and check with 'cargo check' that it compiles before procceeding to the next change. Never run 'cargo run' but let the user test the app themselves.

Also for working with the xsynth crate always study the crate repository at: https://github.com/BlackMIDIDevs/xsynth 

You can clone it into ./tmp directory inside the project directory to have access to all source files. Example of how to work with the xsynth file renderer is at: https://github.com/BlackMIDIDevs/xsynth/tree/master/render 

Realtime synth examples are at: https://github.com/BlackMIDIDevs/xsynth/tree/master/realtime/examples
